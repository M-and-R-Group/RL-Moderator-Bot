# RL-Moderator-Bot
This is a bot for the moderators in the Revision Lounge Discord Server, which helps them manage users and their activities. The code for this bot is taken from discord.py documentation and YouTube videos for inspiration, and has been coded by the Managing Director, Sam March

We want everyone to be able to learn coding, so we have decided to keep this code open-source. If you do decide to use parts of this code, you must accredit us in the code, by using comments, and putting `Some parts of this code have been taken from the Revision Lounge Official Discord Bot Source Code Â©Revision Lounge 2022`

**Us** and **We** refer to Revision Lounge as a company, unless otherwise stated. This has been coded by Samuel March, Managing Director and Lead Developer. discord.py is not affiliated with Revision Lounge, and is only a package used to connect to the Discord Bot API

If you have any questions, please direct them to hello@revisionlounge.co.uk, with `RL Moderator Bot Source Code` in the subject line. We will get back to you as promptly as possible, however, due to other commitments, we may take sometime. If you don't get a reply in one week, please join our Discord server, where we are normally active. You can find the link by going to https://revisionlounge.co.uk
